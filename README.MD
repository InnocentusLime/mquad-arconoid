## What is this

This is just a simple arcanoid implementation with small QoL features and a lil bit of polish (to not make it completely like the examples on the web).

I made it purely to:
1. Practice simple collision detection
2. Get a grip of macroquad
3. Implement something small and finished

## Controls

* Space -- start / reset on GameOver
* WASD/arrow keys -- control your paddle
* F11 -- toggle fullscreen
* Escape -- pause

## The Future

I might revisit this project later. The main goals right now are:
1. Deploying it to the web
2. Making it work on mobile

## Credits

* All sounds have been generated with sfxr
* All graphics are drawn by me
* Font is "oegnek". It can be downloaded from [this itch.io page](https://sonyplaytation.itch.io/oegnec-font)
